#WDI 21 SF - Project One

## DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that you've learned in the past month together! For the first project you will use your knowledge of front and back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends, family or any of the other billions of people who use the Internet. The type of web application you create is your choice.

The objective of this project is to:

* Apply the skills you've learned by building a web application from the ground up.
* Demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.

You will be working **individually** for this first project. Show us what you've got!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* **Express API** Implemented a backend API Express that serves up an html page(s) and a JSON API.
* **RESTful Routes** Design the routes in a [RESTful](http://restfulrouting.com/mappings/resources) manner.
* **MongoDB** Persist at least two models in a Mongo Database.
* **AJAX** Leverage the backend API to fetch JSON asynchronously to the client.
* **jQuery** Use jQuery to manipulate the DOM and/or data on the client-side.
* **Templating** Render the JSON data on the frontend using underscore templates.
* **Authentication** Enable users to signup, login, and logout.
* **Data Validation** Validate data by handling incorrect inputs during sign up, such as unique email addresses, and minimum password lengths.
* **Model Relationship** Create a `has_many` relationship between the User and another model using either embedded or referenced data.
* **Visual Design** Use Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation, or another CSS framework to kick-start your front-end.
* **Heroku** Deploy your code to Heroku without exposing any secret keys (notes on that in the `/tips` directory).

## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
If you want to push yourself and learn something new, optionally consider doing some of the following with your app, but *please talk to an instructor* beforehand:

* **External API** Use an external API to integrate rich data into your app.
* **Authorization** Disallow users from CRUDing content in other users' profiles. Ie a user should not be able to delete a post if it is not theirs.
* **Sass** Use a CSS pre-compiler to write more imperative CSS. 
* **Web Scraping** If necessary, collect data directly from a website that doesn't have an API. Examples technologies include [Casper](http://casperjs.org/) or [Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/).
* **Whatever else you can think of!**

## TIMELINE

* **Friday, Sept 4th** - Communicate your app idea to your lead instructor. Be ready to talk about the scope of your project. Before beginning work on your project, your project idea and the scope of your project must be checked-off by an instructor.  You will need the following for an instructor check-off:
    * Wireframes
    * User stories
    * Models and DB design
    * Github repo w/ Instructor as a collaborator
* **Thursday, Sept 10th** - Deploy your code to Heroku by the end of the day.  It is not important how much coding you have done at this point; deploy whatever you have.  This will make your life easier.
* **Friday, Sept 11th** - Project due and presentations!

## PLANNING

####Before you start coding...

* **Project scope** What are you planning to build? What features will it have? *What do you reasonably think you can implement this in a week?* Think [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)! If you run out of time, will you have at least some working features? Get the core working first, then focus on new features.
* **Wireframes** Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work.
* **User stories** Outline your core user stories and divide them into sub-stories. Use your own [Trello](https://trello.com/) board to track your progress and keep you focused.
* **Object Models** Draw out the Models, their relationship(s), and properties.

*DO NOT start coding before each of the above is clearly outlined and approved by an instructor.*



## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
####Code should be...

* Commented
* Modular
* DRY
* Frequently committed
* Properly indented

####Workflow should be...

* Strategic —
*Were you mindful about balancing your own resourcefulness with seeking help when necessary?* 

* Documented —
*Did you create a project README, illustrate wireframes, write user stories, etc?*
* Defendable —
*Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way as opposed to the other options?*

## ACCESS TO INSTRUCTORS
We will a schedule for 1:1s throughout the week. We will also do mini lessons on certain topics if we notice that several people are running into the same issues.

## Tips

Checkout the [how to](https://github.com/sf-wdi-21/notes/tree/master/how-tos) directory for more great tips on things we didn't get the chance to cover in class, such as:

* Deploying to Heroku
* Hitting APIs from the backend
* Hiding secret keys
* Backend templating w/ EJS
* AND MORE!


##FINAL DELIVERABLES

* Completion of the **core requirements**
* A link to your website **hosted on Heroku**
* A link to your **source code on GitHub**
* A `README.md` file that serves as your **project documentation** (this is important, do it please!)
* A **presentation** illustrating:
	* What is your project and what does it do?
	* What was your motivation to build it?
	* What are you proud of?
	* What would you do with more time?
	* What aspect presented the most challenges?

###HAPPY CODING :)
